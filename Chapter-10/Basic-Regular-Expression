#Regular expression or regex
-regex is a collection of normal and special characters used to find simple or complex patterns
-Normal characters are alphanumeric characters which match themselves: a == a
-Special characters have special meanings when used within patterns like grep and do not match themselves

-"." == any single character, matches any single character except for a new line character
.: grep 'r..f'  would in reef, roof 

-"[]" == a list or range of characters to match one character
[]: grep '[0-9]' would print all numbers in the file.
    grep '[a-d]' would print all letter
note: range has to be incorrect order

-"*" == The previous character repeated zero or more times
-Used to match zero or more occurrences of a character and it's more useful with a pattern
*:grep 'r[oe]*d'

-"^" == if it's the first character in the pattern, it has to be in the beginning of the line to match, otherwise it's just a literal ^ character 
^:grep '^root' would print out line with root as the first word

-"$" == if it's the last character in the pattern, it has to be in the beginning of the line to match, otherwise it's just a literal $ character 
$:grep 'r$' would print lines with r as the last letter

-'\' == used to ignore a regex and use it a literal sign
