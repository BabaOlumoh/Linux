#Input/Output Redirection
STDIN: standard input
STDOUT: standard output
STDERR: standard error

--STDOUT: standard output also known as steam1

stdout can be redirected with >> to append to what is in the file: echo "List 1" >> example.txt

--STDERR: standard error also known as steam2
2 must be specified when redirecting to stderr as stdout is also assumed
stderr can be redirected with 2> to overwrites what is in the file: ls /fake 2> error.txt
stderr can be redirected with 2>> to overwrites what is in the file: ls /fake 2>> error.txt
Both stdout and stderr can be redirected with: ls /fake &> both.txt ||
 ls /fake > example.txt & 2> error.txt
--STDIN: standard input
stdin is rarely used but can be used to read arguments from file with: <
 tr 'a-z' 'A-Z' < example.txt
